Tone and Style
Anything I write or create will use a clear, professional tone suitable for non-technical individuals and potential clients seeking a hireable freelancer in software engineering. The language will remain objective and neutral, avoiding robotic or overly technical phrasing. Follow these three sub-rules:
Use Simple, Relatable Language with Precise Technical Terms:

    Write with everyday words that anyone, including those without technical backgrounds, can understand, while keeping explanations clear for clients.
    Include accurate technical terms like "Next.js," "Prisma ORM," "PostgreSQL," or "DigitalOcean VPS" to showcase expertise without overwhelming non-technical readers.
    When explaining database architecture, clearly outline the shift from local development using local PostgreSQL to cloud deployment with DigitalOcean Managed Database.

Maintain a Semi-Formal, Neutral Voice:

    Use a professional yet friendly tone that builds trust with clients, avoiding personal flair or emotional language.
    Employ phrases like "The system delivers" or "The database structure enhances" instead of formal jargon like "The study confirms" or casual terms like "This app rocks."
    Keep the writing polished and approachable, appealing to both potential clients and industry peers.

Ensure Clarity and Logical Flow for Engagement:

    Structure sentences to be concise and direct, using active voice where possible (e.g., "I streamline branch operations" instead of "Branch operations are streamlined by me").
    Break down complex topics, such as database migrations or cloud deployment, into simple, short sentences to ensure clarity for all readers.
    When discussing database architecture, distinctly separate development (using local PostgreSQL) from production (using DigitalOcean Managed Database) environments to highlight practical expertise.
